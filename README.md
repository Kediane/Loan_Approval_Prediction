# Loan Approval Analysis and Prediction

Performing exploratory data analysis on the loan approval dataset to
prepare it for modeling.
We will be using various machine learning models to predict loan status
outcome and comparing their performance. The model with the highest accuracy
score and precision will be selected. The models we will 
be using are : K-nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random
Forest and Support Vector Machine
